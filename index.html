                    I have always been intrigued by technology! Witnessing the vast amount of change that technology has brought to our world over the past few decades has been astonishing. I am ready to be a part of this movement and I believe that learning web-development and software development are some great first steps to joining this revolution. Aside from my studies I love kayaking, snowboarding, and basketball. When I am not trying to learn something new you can most likely find me doing one of those three activities.</p>
